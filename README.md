A Simple RSS NewsReader Built Using HTML5

At this time (23-02-13), this is simply a proof of concept that actually works on Blackberry, Android and Symbian.

Looks questionable on Desktops :)

To add more news sources, edit the scripts.js file and follow the format.


You can use PhoneGap to compile it for the various platforms. Simply zip up the contents of the html folder and go to http://build.phonegap.com

or visit the platform-specific setups to compile for Android or Blackberry platforms using Eclipse or Blackberry WebWorks respectively.
